Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings,
individually and collectively, and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence
(rationalism and empiricism) over acceptance of dogma or superstition. 
The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements
which have identified with it. The term was coined by theologian Friedrich Niethammer at the
beginning of the 19th century to refer to a system of education based on the study of classical
literature ("classical humanism"). Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that
affirms some notion of human freedom and progress. It views humans as solely responsible for
the promotion and development of individuals and emphasizes a concern for man in relation to
the world.

In modern times, humanist movements are typically non-religious movements aligned with secularism,
and today humanism typically refers to a nontheistic life stance centred on human agency and
looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world.
